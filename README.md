# Londeril's Dotfiles

This is a collection of configuration files, scripts and other useful bits and bobs from my Linux machines.

## What this is and isn't

This repo is first and foremost a way for me to keep track of my configuration changes over the years and a saveguard against loosing hard to replicate configurations after a too hasty executed distro hop or testmachine wipe - as happend in the past...
This repo is not ment to work for other people out of the box - if you find a config or a script which strikes our fancy you are more then welcome to use it in any way shape or form. but please don't hold me accountable for breaking your stuff ;)

## a word on my machines

This config files are used on different machines - most files have a common base with some additions (or substractions) on a per machine basis. depending on the application there is a .common file and a ._machinename_ file. if the application does not support live config file merging all configs are in one file with comments or uncomments on the machines themselfes
