# Londeril's Dotfiles
This is a collection of configuration files, scripts and other useful bits and bobs from my Linux machines.

## What this is and isn't
This repo is first and foremost a way for me to keep track of my configuration changes over the years and a saveguard against loosing hard to replicate configurations after a too hasty executed distro hopp or testmachine whipe - as happend in the past... 
This repo is not ment to work for other people out of the box - if you find a config or a script which strikes our fancy you are more then welcome to use it in any way shape or form. but please don't hold me accountable for breaking your stuff ;)
